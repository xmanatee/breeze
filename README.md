# Breeze Browser

BreezeBrowser automates your web navigation using AI. Simply describe your intent, and it will search, navigate, and interact with websites on your behalf - clicking links, filling forms, and guiding you through complex online tasks effortlessly.

## What is BreezeBrowser?

BreezeBrowser is an AI-powered web browser that transforms your intentions into actions. By simply describing what you want to accomplish online, BreezeBrowser automates the entire process - searching the web, selecting the most relevant links, navigating websites, clicking buttons, filling out forms, and even prompting you when manual input is needed.

## Why did we create it?

Navigating the internet can be overwhelming and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex websites or repetitive tasks like filling out forms. BreezeBrowser simplifies this process by automating web interactions based on your intentions, saving you time and reducing frustration. It's an especially powerful tool for tasks like applying for visas, booking travel, or any online activity that requires multiple steps and detailed information.

## How does it work?

- *Intent-Based Interaction*: Start by telling BreezeBrowser what you want to do - for example, "I need to apply for a Spanish tourist visa."

- *AI-Powered Navigation*: Using advanced AI models, BreezeBrowser interprets your intent, generates a search query, and selects the most appropriate website.

- *Automated Actions*: It automates web navigation steps, such as clicking links and buttons, filling out forms with your stored data, and proceeding through multi-step processes.

- *User Prompts and Guidance*: If additional information is needed, BreezeBrowser will prompt you directly. If a manual action is required (like completing a captcha), it clearly informs you of the next steps.
Customizable Settings: You can adjust AI models, manage your personal data securely stored on your device, and customize how the browser interacts with websites.

## Why choose BreezeBrowser?

BreezeBrowser turns complex web tasks into straightforward, automated processes. It's like having a personal assistant for the internet, making online interactions smoother, faster, and more efficient.


# Implementation

Created using Flutter and [inappwebview](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview) package.

Currently browser is unable to fill out web forms, which is a big limitation, but our team at [nemi.love](https://nemi.love/) is working on it.
